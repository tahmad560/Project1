    <h2>About C Programming</h2>
</header>

<main>
    <div>
        <h3>Origins (1969&minus;1973)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Creators:</b> C was developed by Dennis Ritchie at Bell Labs between 1969 and 1973.</li>
            <li><b>Purpose:</b> It was created to rewrite the UNIX operating system. Before C, UNIX was written in assembly language, which was hardware-specific. C introduced a higher-level, portable language, making UNIX more adaptable.</li>
            <li><b>Influences:</b>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>B:</b> A simplified language developed by Ken Thompson, which itself was a descendant of BCPL (Basic Combined Programming Language).</li>
                    <li><b>Assembly Language:</b> C incorporated low-level functionality inspired by assembly, which made it highly efficient for system programming.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h3>Standardization</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><b>K&R C (1978):</b> Dennis Ritchie and Brian Kernighan published the book <i>The C Programming Language</i>. This book formalized Câ€™s syntax and features, becoming the de facto standard for years.</li>
            <li><b>ANSI C (1989):</b> The American National Standards Institute (ANSI) standardized C, which became known as ANSI C or C89.</li>
            <li><b>ISO Standard (1990):</b> The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) adopted ANSI C as the global standard (ISO/IEC 9899:1990).</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h3>Key Features</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Portability:</b> Programs written in C could run on different types of machines with minimal changes.</li>
            <li><b>Low-Level Access:</b> C allowed developers to manipulate memory and hardware directly, making it ideal for system programming.</li>
            <li><b>Rich Standard Library:</b> It included many functions for handling input/output, memory, and strings.</li>
            <li><b>Efficiency:</b> C is known for its speed and low overhead, making it suitable for embedded systems and real-time applications.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h3>C's Impact</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><b>UNIX:</b> C became the foundation for the UNIX operating system, influencing modern operating systems like Linux and macOS.</li>
            <li><b>Programming Languages:</b> C inspired the creation of many other languages, including C++, Java, C#, Objective-C, Go, and even parts of Python.</li>
            <li><b>Embedded Systems:</b> C remains the dominant language in embedded systems development.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h3>Modern C</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><b>C99:</b> Released in 1999, this standard introduced new features like inline functions, variable-length arrays, and better support for floating-point math.</li>
            <li><b>C11:</b> Published in 2011, adding multithreading support and improving portability.</li>
            <li><b>C17 and C23:</b> Introduced minor improvements to keep the language relevant.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
</main>

<footer>
    C remains one of the most widely used and enduring programming languages in the world, critical for systems programming, software development, and computer science education.
